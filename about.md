# About Me  

Hi, I’m Ivan Johnson 
I’m interested in robotics and video games.  

Here’s a bit about me:  

- I’m in grade 11 (15 years old) in Port Credit Secondary School (PCSS)
- I am a Christian from Goa, India
- I enjoy working on coding projects and building with lego
- My goal is to do well in the game we call life
