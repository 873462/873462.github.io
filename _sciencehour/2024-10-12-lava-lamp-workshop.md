In this hands-on workshop, participants dove into the **science of density** and created their very own DIY lava lamps!  

The session began with a fun experiment layering liquids of different densities — such as **water**, **oil**, and **syrup** — to demonstrate how some liquids float while others sink. Participants explored why this happens by discussing how molecules in each liquid behave differently based on their density.  

The highlight of the workshop was crafting **homemade lava lamps** using simple materials like vegetable oil, water, food coloring, and Alka-Seltzer tablets. As participants dropped the tablets into their bottles, they marveled at the colorful, bubbling “lava” effect caused by the reaction between the water and tablets, pushing colorful blobs through the oil.  

By the end of the session, everyone left with their own lava lamp and a deeper understanding of the fascinating science behind **liquid density** and **chemical reactions**!
