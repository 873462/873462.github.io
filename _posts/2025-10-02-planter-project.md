# DIY Planter 🌱  

I recently made a **planter** from scratch! It was a fun project where I learned about design and DIY crafting.  

### Steps I Followed
1. Designed the shape and size of the planter  
2. Cut the pieces  
3. Built and assembled the planter  
4. Painted and decorated it  
5. Planted my favorite plant 🌿  

### Cutting the Pieces ✂️
Here are some pictures of the cut pieces:

### Lessons Learned
- A goal without a plan is just a wish  
- Measure twice, Cut once  
- Patience is key for any DIY project

### Finished Project 🎉
Here’s the final planter:
