# Anscombe’s Quartet – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*By Ivan Johnson — October 9, 2025*

## 📘 Introduction

This project explores **Anscombe’s Quartet**, a famous dataset created by statistician *Francis Anscombe* in 1973 to show the importance of **data visualization**.

Although all four datasets share nearly identical statistical properties (mean, variance, correlation, etc.), their scatter plots reveal **strikingly different patterns**.

> “Statistics are not enough — always visualize your data.”

We used Seaborn’s built-in version of the Anscombe dataset.  
Each subset (I, II, III, IV) has identical summary statistics but drastically different distributions.
