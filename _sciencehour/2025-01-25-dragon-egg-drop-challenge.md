In this hands-on workshop, participants explored the **science of forces, energy transfer, and material properties** by designing a protective nest for a dragon’s egg! 🐉🥚  

The session began with exciting demonstrations of key physics concepts:
- Dropping objects from various heights to see how **impact forces** change with height  
- Using **rubber bands** to show **energy transfer** and why reducing it helps protect fragile objects  
- Dropping a ball onto materials like **cotton balls**, **paper**, **bubble wrap**, and **rubber bands** to compare how each absorbs impact differently  

The highlight of the workshop was the **Dragon Egg Drop Challenge**, where participants designed and built nests capable of cushioning their eggs from tall drops.  
As the eggs were put to the test, the room filled with excitement and suspense — would the dragon eggs survive the fall?  

By the end of the session, everyone walked away with a better understanding of **forces, energy, and materials** — and hopefully, an **uncracked dragon’s egg!** 🥚✨
