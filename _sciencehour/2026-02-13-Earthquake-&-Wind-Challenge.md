In this hands-on engineering workshop, participants explored the science of **stability, structural design, and forces** by building towers designed to survive extreme conditions!
  

The session began with a short discussion on **center of mass, base width, weight distribution, and structural reinforcement.** We talked about how real engineers design skyscrapers and bridges to withstand **earthquakes and strong winds**, and what makes certain shapes more stable than others.

Then came the challenge:

**Build the Tallest Structure Possible — But It Must Survive!**

Participants worked in teams to design and construct tall towers using the provided materials. The goal wasn’t just height — it was **height + stability**.

Once construction was complete, the real testing began:

**Earthquake Test:** We simulated seismic activity by shaking the table.  
**Wind Test:** A fan was used at different speeds to simulate wind gusts.

Some towers swayed but held strong. Others collapsed dramatically — which led to awesome discussions about **why certain designs failed and how to improve them.**

By the end of the workshop, participants had hands-on experience with key STEM concepts including:

• Structural engineering  
• Force and motion  
• Stability vs. height trade-offs  
• Iterative design (build → test → improve)  

Most importantly, they learned that failure isn’t the end — it’s part of the engineering process. 💡

### The Engineering Behind It

A structure’s stability depends on several factors:

• **Wide Base:** A larger base lowers the center of gravity and prevents tipping.  
• **Weight Distribution:** Evenly distributed mass reduces imbalance.  
• **Reinforcement:** Triangles and cross-bracing add rigidity.  
• **Flexibility:** Slight flexibility can help absorb earthquake energy instead of snapping.

Real-world engineers use similar principles when designing buildings in earthquake-prone regions or areas with strong winds.

This workshop turned physics and engineering into a fun, competitive, and unforgettable STEM experience!
