This workshop focused on **air pressure**, **Newton’s Laws of Motion**, and how simple materials can be used to demonstrate powerful physics in action!  

Participants built their own **DIY balloon hovercrafts** using **CDs**, **balloons**, **bottle caps**, and **hot glue guns**.  
As air escaped from the inflated balloon through the hole in the CD, the escaping air created a thin cushion between the CD and the table — reducing friction and allowing the hovercraft to glide smoothly.  

During the session, students connected this to **Newton’s Third Law** (“for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction”) — understanding how the downward air push caused the craft to lift and move across the surface.  

By the end of the event, participants had working hovercrafts zooming across tables and floors — powered entirely by air pressure and curiosity 🚀
