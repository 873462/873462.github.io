In this hands-on workshop, participants explored the **science of air pressure** through exciting experiments that brought key concepts to life! 🌬️  

The session began with an investigation into **trapped air** — participants dipped an upside-down plastic cup into a tray of water and discovered that the inside stayed perfectly dry.  

Next came the **“Hulk Strength”** experiment 💪 — a simple setup of a napkin, water, candle, and cup that allowed them to lift an entire tray using air pressure alone!  

Further experiments showed how air pressure affects **airflow and force**. By attaching a balloon to a plastic bottle and covering a small hole, participants learned how controlling air movement could stop the balloon from inflating or deflating.  

Finally, the day ended with an action-packed **DIY Vortex Cannon** activity, where students used a plastic bottle and a stretched balloon to launch marshmallows across the room — a perfect demonstration of **stored energy and motion** in action! 🍬🎯  

By the end of the session, everyone had a hands-on understanding of how **air pressure** shapes the world around them — one floating balloon, levitating tray, and flying marshmallow at a time.
